*W*Y*A* Teleport Service : TECHCONNECT

This project is an interactive tool using technology to share real-world adjacent experiences for people existing in different places. 

The intention is to use this site as an invitation to a live stream event at an immersive venue (CCT). 

This event focuses on groups of folks from areas where higher numbers of people have emmigrated. 
There is a certain quality of face to face interactions that being on the phone or facetime can miss. 
This project offers a space to share experiences with loved ones in a way that mirrors everyday life. 

In it's entirety the production of this project explores and points to questions around the use and availability of live stream camera's on different continents and in different countries.

Livestream camera's are used often as a tool for protection or observation and research but where and what are these camera's protecting? 

Patterns were revealed in the the creation of this site that explore a "globalized view" as it stands today. What does this "view" highlight? This aspect of the project I am interested in exploring further on the backend.
